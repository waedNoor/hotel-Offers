i chose JAVA programming language because i have an excellent experience in it, it's one of the best programming languages in the world, and it's fast,portable,distributed,multithreaded,robust,Secured and high Performance.




Thinking Process:
1- json parsing by manged bean (ApplicationScoped)
2-put the hotel details in "Constants.java" as hashMap
3- each hotel has 5 category of details (destination, hotelInfo, hotel pricing details, offerDateRange)
create 5 DO's for each categoray in package called "DO" and craete parent DO "AbstarctDO"
4- create HotelDO that has all of the above DO(destinationDO,hotelPricingDO,hotelInfoDO,offerDateRangeDO)
to save the data foreach hotel.
5- create search page as jsf page and use the manaed bean "mbOffers" to do search process in the Constants.{data that saved in it}
and depend on the search critiria .

6- i tried to make the search is simply(i meant the user can fill any field, no constraints on what he have to fill)
7- view the result as 
image of the hotel and the stars rate for it, and its name and where,and number of reviews

and the home page has the default list of all hotels.
